# To-Do App Angular

This project demonstrates key Angular concepts and features essential for building robust web applications. It includes components for modular UI development, __data communication through Inputs and Outputs__, __dynamic UI updates with binding (string interpolation, property, event, and two-way binding), state management with Signals, conditional rendering using @if/ngIf, list rendering with @for/ngFor, and form handling with ngSubmit__. Advanced features like __Services with Dependency Injection__, __pipes for data transformation__, and the use of __ng-content__ for content projection are also implemented.
